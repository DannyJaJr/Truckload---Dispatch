## Explanations of the technologies used
1. Technologies used: Python, HTML, Bootstrap,  Django, NGROk for local hosting, Django-extensions for scripts.
## A couple paragraphs about the general approach you took
1. Bootstrap is used to separate data rendered from the models with classes containers, cols, and rows, {block content} on the base.html to display many arguments.
2. Bootstrap file is downloaded and unzipped as static style folder: https://mdbootstrap.com/
3. Media file is created and added to the settings.py and configurated as a static file to store image or logos for a loads card: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/howto/static-files/
4. https://ngrok.com/ for tunneling with localhost to import and adding data from the dispatch to the truckload board.
